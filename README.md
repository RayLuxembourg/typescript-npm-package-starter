# typescript-npm-package-starter

Start your own npm package with types to ease developer experience when using your packages.

Clone this repo and start adding your code inside the src folder.

Before you publish your code, run `yarn build` or `npm run build` 

this will save your code as JavaScript files with `*.d.ts` files

which will provide typing information for developers even without typescript.

Exporting types will allow developers who are using typescript in their project, to import those types.
